# Image Captioning Node.js Application

This is a Node.js application for generating captions for images using a combination of ResNet50 as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for generating textual descriptions.

## Features

- Utilizes ResNet50 for image feature extraction.
- LSTM model for generating captions based on image features.
- Node.js backend for serving image captioning functionality.
- Simple RESTful API for easy integration into other applications.

## Requirements

- Node.js (>= 10.x)
- npm (>= 6.x)
- Python (>= 3.x) with TensorFlow and Keras installed

## Installation

    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd image-captioning-nodejs
    npm install
    ```


4. Start the application:

    ```bash
